## About

I was asked to come up with a Neural Network capable of giving related terms to a word. This is useful when you're doing a [systematic review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review) since related terms can help you build your search string. So, instead of a Neural Network, I came up with this. This script get the related terms from [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org). It's kinda silly, but it works.
